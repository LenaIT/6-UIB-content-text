            strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The
            fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and
            sweetness. It
            is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice
            cream,
            milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in
            products
            such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.</p>
            <p>The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of <i>Fragaria
                virginiana</i>
            from eastern North America and <i>Fragaria chiloensis</i>, which was brought from Chile by
            Amédée-François
            Frézier
            in 1714.<sup>[2]</sup> Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the
            woodland
            strawberry (<i>Fragaria vesca</i>), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early
            17th
            century.

            <p>The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry. Technically, it is an aggregate
            accessory
            fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle
            that
            holds the ovaries. Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the
            ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.<sup>[4]</sub></p>
            <p>In 2017, world production of strawberries was 9.2 million tonnes, led by China with 40% of the total.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Two subspecies of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The introduction of F. virginiana from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century is an important part of history because it is one of the two species that give rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712 introduced a strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that we have today.<br><br>

            The Mapuche and Huilliche Indians of Chile cultivated the female strawberry species until 1551, when the Spanish came to conquer the land. In 1765, a European explorer recorded the cultivation of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry. At first introduction to Europe, the plants grew vigorously but produced no fruit. French gardeners in Brest and Cherbourg around the mid 18th century first noticed that when F. moschata and F. virginiana were planted in between rows of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry would bear abundant and unusually large fruits. Soon after, Antoine Nicolas Duchesne began to study the breeding of strawberries and made several discoveries crucial to the science of plant breeding, such as the sexual reproduction of strawberry which he published in 1766. Duchesne discovered that the female F. chiloensis plants could only be pollinated by male F. moschata or F. virginiana plants.[6] This is when the Europeans became aware that plants had the ability to produce male-only or female-only flowers.<br><br>
            
            Duchesne determined F. ananassa to be a hybrid of F. chiloensis and F. virginiana. F. ananassa, which produces large fruits, is so-named because it resembles the pineapple in smell, taste and berry shape. In England, many varieties of F. ananassa were produced to form the basis of modern varieties of strawberries currently cultivated and consumed. Further breeding were also conducted in Europe and America to improve the hardiness, disease resistance, size, and taste of strawberries.</p>
